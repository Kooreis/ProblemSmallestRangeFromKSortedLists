# Question: How do you find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of k sorted lists? C# Summary

The C# program is designed to find the smallest range that includes at least one number from each of the k sorted lists. It begins by initializing a sorted set and a variable to keep track of the maximum value. It then iterates through each list, adding the first element of each list to the sorted set and updating the maximum value if necessary. The program then enters a loop where it continuously removes the smallest element from the sorted set and checks if the current range (from the smallest to the maximum value) is smaller than the previously found range. If it is, the range is updated. If the removed element's list contains more elements, the next element is added to the sorted set and the maximum value is updated if necessary. This process continues until the sorted set no longer contains elements from all lists. The smallest range found during this process is then returned.

# Python Differences

The Python version of the solution uses a priority queue to solve the problem, while the C# version uses a sorted set. Both data structures are used to keep track of the smallest and largest elements in the current range, but they work in slightly different ways. 

In the C# version, a SortedSet is used to store tuples of the form (value, list index, element index), and the set is sorted by the value. The maximum value in the current range is also tracked separately. The smallest tuple is removed from the set in each iteration, and if the next element in the corresponding list exists, it is added to the set. The range is updated whenever a smaller range is found.

In the Python version, a priority queue (implemented as a heap) is used to store tuples of the form (value, list index, element index), and the heap is sorted by the value. The maximum value in the current range is also tracked separately. The smallest tuple is popped from the heap in each iteration, and if the next element in the corresponding list exists, it is pushed onto the heap. The range is updated whenever a smaller range is found.

The main difference between the two versions is the data structure used to keep track of the smallest and largest elements in the current range. The Python version uses a heap, which is a binary tree-based data structure that allows efficient retrieval and removal of the smallest element, while the C# version uses a SortedSet, which is a binary search tree-based data structure that allows efficient retrieval and removal of both the smallest and largest elements.

Another difference is the way tuples are used. In C#, a Tuple is a class that can hold multiple values of different types, while in Python, a tuple is a built-in data type that can hold multiple values of any type. The Python version uses tuples to store the value, list index, and element index, while the C# version uses Tuples to store the same information.

The Python version also uses list comprehensions and the built-in `max` function to initialize the priority queue and the maximum value, while the C# version uses a for loop and the `Math.Max` method. 

Finally, the Python version uses the `heapq` module to manipulate the priority queue, while the C# version uses methods of the SortedSet class. The `heapq` module provides functions to convert a regular list into a heap, push an element onto the heap, and pop the smallest element from the heap, while the SortedSet class provides methods to add an element to the set, remove an element from the set, and retrieve the smallest and largest elements in the set.

# Java Differences

The Java and C# versions of the solution are quite similar in their approach to solving the problem. Both versions use a data structure (a SortedSet in C# and a PriorityQueue in Java) to keep track of the smallest and largest elements in the current range, and update the range as they iterate through the lists. 

However, there are some differences in the language features and methods used in the two versions:

1. In the C# version, a Tuple is used to store the value, the list index, and the element index. In the Java version, a custom Node class is used for the same purpose. This is because Java does not have built-in tuples like C#.

2. The C# version uses the SortedSet data structure from the System.Collections.Generic namespace, which automatically sorts the elements as they are added. The Java version uses a PriorityQueue from the java.util package, which also sorts the elements but in a queue format.

3. The C# version uses the Min property of the SortedSet to get the smallest element, and the Remove method to remove it. The Java version uses the poll method of the PriorityQueue to retrieve and remove the smallest element.

4. The C# version uses the Count property of the SortedSet to check if it contains elements from all the lists. The Java version uses the size method of the PriorityQueue for the same purpose.

5. The C# version uses the Math.Max method to find the maximum of two numbers. The Java version uses the Math.max method for the same purpose.

6. The C# version returns the range as a Tuple, while the Java version returns it as an array of two integers.
